Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?

    boolean - represents a True or False value. It has a size of 1 bit.
    char - In Java, char (character) is a 16-bit type having a range of 0 to 65,535. The standard 8-bit ASCII character set is a subset of Unicode and ranges from 0 to 127. ASCII characters are valid Java characters. Since char is an unsigned 16-bit type, it is possible to perform arithmetic manipulations on a char variable such as incrementing.
    byte - A twos complement integer. It has a size of 8 bits.
    short - A unicode character.
    int - Represents an integer value. Only whole numbers can be assigned as an int value. It has a maximum size of 32 bits.
    long - Represents an integer value. Only whole numbers can be assigned as a long value. It has a maximum size of 64 bits.
    To allow numbers with fractional components, Java defines two floating-point types: float and double, which represent single and double precision values, respectively.
    float - A floating point number with a maximum value of 32 bits.
    double - A floaing point number with a maximum value of 64 bits.

    What is the difference between a short and a Char?

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.

    int x == 42

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?

    widening

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?

    double b == 0.09

    int a = b

    int a = (int) b

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
    + - * / %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
    <
    <=
    >
    >=
    ==
    !=

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
   a <= 10

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
    $ | ^|| && !
    boolean

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
    b <= 10 && a >=11

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
    int x =0 ; x <= 0 ; x++

11.) What data type is a String?
    Object

12.) Are string mutable?
    yes

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?

15.) What is an array?

16.) What is the first index of an array?

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
